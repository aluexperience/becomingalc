                            University is a dream far-fetched if you come from a low-income family, barely making enough to pay for your secondary education. I worked very hard at A-level and passed with brilliant results. Stumbled upon the African Leadership College (ALC) as l was looking for the most innovative spaces to nurture my talent and transform my dreams into goals.<br><br>
 
                           I boldly applied and got waitlisted for a full scholarship. Was surprised when the admissions team told me my application was one of the best in the current application pool. I had applied to ALC primarily because of the diversity of the campus and its location, MAURITIUSSSSSSSSS. Honestly, the main reason was the island, l wanted a place far away, where l could establish, have a tropical island lifestyle and do great things.<br><br>

                           I engaged with resources to familiarize myself with Mauritius and the ALC culture, and joined the admitted students' WhatsApp group. There, I had insightful conversations with brilliant leaders. A lot happened between the waiting period and getting to Mauritius because of Covid-19. That was stressful but manageable. Even though I had to stay in Rwanda for 2 weeks because of Covid-19 restrictions, I rejoiced when the school scheduled flights to the island.<br><br>

                           For the past year, ALC has been amazing, it's been full of challenges and glories. I have come to like how diversity is embraced and everyone is allowed to be themselves. Not being utopic, there are always some challenges of bias from countries with a  lot more students. The most challenging part has been academics, getting used to the heavy workload and self-driven learning took a toll on most students and me. Nevertheless, you cope very well once you learn to manage your time effectively and prioritize your activities. Being part of ALC connects you to a lot of opportunities from the African Leadership Group (ALG). Which you have to be ready for when they come around.<br><br> 

                          To wrap up, l am happy that l came to ALC, and I am enjoying the tropical island vibes while on my way to my dream life. I  could see myself living in Mauritius for the next 10 years. The people here are very nice and there are a lot of cool places to visit. I only wish l had learned French early, but overall it's been one of the best experiences.<br><br>

                            My odyssey so far at the African Leadership College (ALC) has been flavorful, with a lot of twists and turns. Yet, as said by our university’s tagline, ” Do hard things and have fun”, such have I dealt with life so far.<br><br>

                           First and foremost, let me introduce myself; my name is Arasen Parmanum, and I am a Mauritian. During my high school years, I attended a robotics boot camp at ALC and since then the environment has left a positive impression on me. For this reason, I decided to apply there as soon as I was done with high school.<br><br>

                          In 2020, after waiting for endless months, I received my admission decision from the ALC team. Happiness was at its peak when I learned I was admitted. Then, it skyrocketed when I saw I earned a scholarship. After that moment, the only feelings were impatience and excitement about getting to ALC.<br><br>

                          Though the wait was long, we had a taste of what was awaiting us on campus through PAVE. As quickly as time flew, there came the moment to go to campus. The first month was packed with emotions and many activities to accustom us to the campus environment. The upcoming months got better as I had the privilege to meet people from all over Africa and connect with them. ALC also helped me in forging my career path and mission. The aspect that helped the most was, getting friends with the same vision as me.<br><br>

                          On an end note, my advice to prospective students would be to take your chance and apply. Be daring and make the leap towards joining an institution with an innovative mindset that has so many resources to help you in fulfilling your goal in life.<br><br>

                            Welcome to my journey, my name is Augusta Lynn. I come from Bafoussam, a region in the west part of Cameroon. I grew up in Douala, where I graduated from Sacred Heart College. Thereafter, I proceeded with my studies at the African Science Academy (ASA) in Tema.<br><br>

                            ASA is a school set up to educate girls in Africa passionate about STEM. There, I had the opportunity to grow up academically and improved my intrapersonal skills such as time management, resilience, and self-discipline. I was able to move out of my comfort zone and meet ladies from different backgrounds and mindsets. This taught me how to be more open-minded.<br><br> 

                            Moving from ASA, where I heard about the African Leadership College (ALC) was a huge step for me. Despite the recommendation by my previous institution to attend ALC, my greatest motivation to attend it was the fact that I was willing to meet new people and learn from them.<br><br>

                           Though scared of not getting selected, I went on with my application. My application process was facilitated by the help of amazing people I had met at ASA. Fingers crossed, I could feel goosebumps rushing through my skin as a read I was admitted. Quite funny how I keep moving between African leading institutions. That certainly reflects my desire to learn more about Africa and Africans as a whole.<br><br>

                           After admission, I was introduced to Cameroonians equally going to ALC. Moving to Mauritius was easier, knowing that I had people to rely on and friends who quickly became family. I remember how much we were admired by other students for our Unity. Undoubtedly, ALC helped me to meet stunning people from Mauritius, Cameroon, Rwanda, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Tanzania, and more. Just for the relations, I have established so far, I would advise students to apply to ALC. Additionally, the learning environment is ideal for everyone, multitaskers, slow or fast learners, and others.<br><br>

                           Indeed, my decision to come to ALC has been one of the smartest I have ever made. I am glad and proud to say I have experienced an incredible leadership life so far. From organizing to participating in events as well as taking part in the astounding working committees such as the Catering Committee and the Student Representative Council, I appreciate it all. Can’t wait to make the most of my stay in Mauritius and ALC.<br><br>

                            My name is Nancy Rokia, I am twenty years old. I was born and bred in Kenya. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I had just graduated from high school. I was doing online courses in digital marketing and basic coding because I wanted to major in Computer Science.<br><br>

                            My father learned about African Leadership University (ALU) via an advertisement while working online from home. It was during the global epidemic, and the internet was our only gateway to the outside world. He promptly informed me of the incredible opportunity, which was initially frightening. Soon, I began researching the university and the vast prospects available to me due to its prestigious evaluations and achievements.<br><br> 

                            To be honest, I was initially apprehensive about studying outside my country, since I dread change. My parents walked me through the diverse opportunities and experiences I would acquire. True to their word, my ALU journey has been one of the most authentic and eye-opening experiences of my life. The application process was both seamless and demanding while being simple and convenient. They wanted me to explore my entrepreneurial side.<br><br>

                            Additionally, this was an opportunity, though intriguing, for me to ideate how I might add value to my African community. Before arriving at campus, the institution offered an introductory course called PAVE that gave me a taste of the university dynamic. At ALC, an integrated curriculum is used, that ties together diverse areas of studies by cutting through subject lines and highlighting common themes. Integration focuses on establishing links for students, allowing participation in relevant everyday activities.<br><br>

                            Relocating was challenging for me at first, but with time and the company I kept, I was able to develop a new sense of home on the island. The opportunity to interact with a diverse group of students has been the most rewarding aspect of my trip. I've always wanted to travel overseas, but had never recognized the richness of the African culture and inclusive environment that ALU fosters.<br><br>

                            The best advice I would give prospective students would be to be open-minded and eager to build themselves and their brand while enriching their minds with smart tactical knowledge. They should as well continue to develop their entrepreneurial spirit alongside pursuing their degree.<br><br>

                            “Mission not majors’ that's what attracted me to ALC.

My name is Reggie Joseph Okoko (he/him), a rising junior from Kenya pursuing Computer Science at the Glasgow Caledonian University- ALC. I was born and grew up in the bustling metropolis of Nairobi, Kenya. Before joining ALC, I was an Electrical and Electronic Engineering student at the University of Nairobi.<br><br>

I first heard about ALC when researching ALA, its founding school. I was attracted to the diversity and inclusion at ALC, getting a world-class degree while still enjoying the beauty of the continent. With the Glasgow Caledonian University- ALC, students earn the world-recognized UK accredited degree in Mauritius.<br><br>
 
The application process to ALC was vigorous but straightforward. I took an aptitude test, no preparation required, then wrote an essay prompt and submitted my creative piece showcasing my passion; this was so fun. It gives an applicant a chance to animate and bring life to your application. Viola! I got an admission offer and qualified for a full-ride scholarship.<br><br>

I traveled to Mauritius at the height of the pandemic and took several Covid-19 tests. After 2 weeks of quarantine in a 5-star hotel, the orientation week was fun and eye-opening. It was marked with the legendary Ikaze ceremony, where we dressed up in our ethnic attires for the induction at the torch lighting ceremony.<br><br>

African Leadership College is a plethora of cultures, languages, ideologies, and philosophies. 
27 Nationalities and 100 languages are spoken on our campus, a melting pot of ideas, the zeitgeist of a new dawn.<br><br>

ALC is a beautiful tapestry of intersectionalities, complexities, and nuances in our beautiful continent Africa. From having late-night discussions on campus over coffee, debating on the harsh political and economic realities and parallels that exist in our different countries to arguing which is better Ghanian Jollof, Nigerian Jollof, or is it East African Pilau?<br><br>  

My favorite course in my freshman year was Projects I, got to work with clients hands-on on solving real-world problems. I worked with Ciel textile, The Room global, and Regeneration Mauritius. This ignited my passion for project management and product development in engineering.<br><br>

My journey at African Leadership College so far has been incredible. The close-knit community, small class sizes, and high faculty-to-student ratio has made ALC not a university but a community. The support system at ALC is imperative, and as a Queer student, I feel welcomed. LGBTQI+ society is active, and I celebrated my first pride at ALC in 2021 in pomp and color.<br><br>

The entrepreneurial spirit and ecosystem at ALC are extensive, from coaching, global conferences, and symposiums to funding opportunities. I have received funding and launched 2 of my start-ups so far. I am honored and excited to be the next generation of leaders shaping the future of Africa in the spirit of our college ‘Do Hard Things! ‘<br><br>

                            I am Amos Kasumba, a Ugandan of Rwandan descent with a dream of making education available to more young people in the rural areas of Uganda and Africa.<br><br>

While browsing the internet, I stumbled upon a tweet from the youth connect Africa (YCA) official page calling for young leaders to give a shot to the Patoranking Scholarships by the African Leadership University. At this point, I was finishing the second year of a self-sponsored BSC in Computer Networks And Systems Administration at Bugema University. However, due to financial constraints, I was on the verge of taking a break off to find alternative sources of income for my school dues.<br><br> 

While contemplating the way forward, I convinced myself that there was no harm in giving a shot to the scholarship while finding other alternatives. I took the bull by the horns and registered my interest for admissions consideration as the first step. Within a few days, I had a response from the admissions team, a green light for the next step. This was just but the beginning of a thrilling journey, as I was not about to give up until I had my scholarship decision. While many applications take a while before the applicants receive their decisions, I suffered minimal anxiety since mine came in a month.<br><br>

Fast-forward I was among the ten beneficiaries of the Patoranking Scholarship and in no time I was on a chartered flight with fellow young leaders Mauritius bound (African Leadership College). Divided into cohorts, we embarked in Leadership Core, a collection of amazing courses that covered our freshman year. I cannot say that it was the easiest time because I had not imagined a lockdown in a foreign country, nor had I expected to stay away from my family for more than six months straight. However, I must admit that this opportunity opened doors to the budding of now strong relationships and personal growth, which I boast.<br><br>

Because time waits for no one, the end of the freshman year drew us to the second year of academic progress. The future was lit brighter as we embarked on the core modules for our courses. As one that had difficulty with programming, it was yet another round; fortunately, I had and continue to have a better experience with assistance from my colleagues and during office hours with teaching assistants and faculty.<br><br> 

As my journey continues, I am glad to mention that I am proud of the decision that I made to join the African Leadership University. To one looking for a school rich in diversity of culture and ideas, with education relevant for today and the times to come, look no further than ALU.<br><br>
